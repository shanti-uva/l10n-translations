# l10n-translations
A repository of translation files used by various apps throughout SHANTI for localization

The files are organized according to framework (Drupal, Rails, etc.).
Subfolders within the framework folder are included as necessary.
Subfolders for different languages are not included because for the present these are only Tibetan translations. 
Each framework folder should have its own README file.

These files and translations are for custom strings within the Shanti and do not include 
core string translations and the like if those are stored in centralized repositories.
