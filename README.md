# Mandala Localization Files
A repository of translation files used by various apps throughout the UVA Mandala Platform for localization.

The files are organized according to framework (Drupal, Rails, etc.), though currently only Drupal files are here.
Currently, only translations of English labels into Tibetan are available.
All Drupal Localization files are in the .po format as [used by Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/node/1814954). 
They are text files that can easily be manipulated for other purposes or can be read directly with [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/).

The Drupal files are organized into three groups:

1. Custom Modules : Translations for custom Drupal modules written for Mandala Apps (See the folder for the complete list)
2. Custom Themes : Translations for the Mandala App Drupal Themes (See the folder for the complete list)
3. Drupal Core : Translations for Drupal core broken down into the standard groups:
   * Built-in Interface (The main file)
   * Contact Forms
   * Fields
   * Menus
   * Node Types
   * Panels
   * Taxonomy
   * Views

The translations can also be found at the [Drupal Localization Hub](https://localize.drupal.org/translate/languages/bo).
