# Drupal Translations
This section of the repo contains translations for Drupal modules and themes in SHANTI.

They are .po files to be uploaded into Drupal sites through the I18N interface.
They are organized into module and theme folders. Each of these folders contains all languages in that category, though at present only Tibetan has been done.
The module folder contains only custom SHANTI modules and not contrib modules on the Drupal site.

Contrib modules and Drupal Core can be found at [Tibetan Localization Page](https://localize.drupal.org/translate/languages/bo) for Drupal.
